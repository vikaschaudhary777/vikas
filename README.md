Model Details
Project Name: Bank Customer Churn Prediction

Objective: Build a machine learning model to predict which bank customers are at risk of churning (closing their accounts).

Data Acquisition:

Login to Kaggle and navigate to the "Explore" section. Search for "bank churn" datasets. There are several options, consider these two: Bank Customer Churn Prediction by Shubham Meshram (Dataset 1) Bank Customer Churn Dataset by Gaurav Topre (Dataset 2) Choose a dataset that best suits your needs based on factors like data size, features included, and user reviews (if available). Click on the chosen dataset and select "Download" to save the CSV file. Data Understanding and Preprocessing:

Upload the downloaded CSV file to your Kaggle workspace using the "My Data" -> "Upload data" option. Go to your uploaded dataset and click on "Explore" to see a summary of features, data types, and potential missing values. Use Python libraries like pandas or built-in Kaggle tools to: Handle missing values (e.g., imputation, deletion) Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding) Scale numerical features (e.g., standardization, normalization) if necessary Model Building:

Import necessary libraries like pandas, scikit-learn for machine learning tasks. Split your data into training and testing sets using functions like train_test_split from scikit-learn. Typical splits are 80% for training and 20% for testing. Choose a machine learning model for classification. Here are some common options for churn prediction: Logistic Regression: A good baseline model, easy to interpret. Random Forest: Powerful ensemble method, handles non-linear relationships well. XGBoost: Gradient boosting technique, often performs well in churn prediction tasks. Train the model on the training data. This involves fitting the model to learn patterns from the data. Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data. Use metrics like: Accuracy: Overall percentage of correct predictions. Precision: Ratio of true positives to all positive predictions (avoiding false positives). Recall: Ratio of true positives to all actual positive cases (avoiding false negatives). F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics. Model Refinement:

Analyze the model's performance. Look for areas of improvement like high false positives or negatives. Try techniques like: Hyperparameter tuning: Adjusting model parameters to improve performance. Feature engineering: Creating new features from existing ones to potentially capture better relationships. Trying different machine learning models (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosting Machines) Saving and Interpretation:

Save your final model using libraries like pickle or joblib for future use. Use the trained model to predict churn probability for new customer data. Analyze the model's coefficients (Logistic Regression) or feature importances (Random Forest, XGBoost) to understand which factors most influence customer churn. Additional Considerations:

This is a basic framework. You can customize it based on the specific dataset and chosen libraries. Explore visualization techniques to understand relationships between features and churn. Consider saving your work as a Kaggle Notebook to document your process, share findings, and potentially participate in competitions. By following these steps and using the resources available on Kaggle, you can build a bank customer churn prediction model and gain valuable insights into customer behavior.
